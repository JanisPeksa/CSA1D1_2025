"When would you use multiple if statements instead of else if?": I typically don't use them if i need a lot of checks.
Match case statements fit better if you need to check a lot of conditions,especially user inputs

"What are the drawbacks of too many if else statements?" :your program has to check conditions one by one which takes time and resources.
On the other hand match case statements only do the operation that their case is made for
