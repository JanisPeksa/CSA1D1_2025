Task 1 — Consecutive Increasing Sequence Length
Write a program that:
Asks the user for the size of an array.
Reads that many integers.
Finds the length of the longest strictly increasing consecutive sequence.
Example:
Input: 3 5 6 2 3 4 1 → Longest increasing run is 2 3 4, length = 3

Task 2 — Shift Array Right by K Steps (Manual)
Write a program that:
Reads n and then n integers into an array.
Asks the user for k.
Manually rotates the array to the right by k positions, without using a second array.
Example:
Array: [1,2,3,4,5], k=2 → [4,5,1,2,3]

Task 3 — Merge Two Sorted Arrays 
Write a program that:
Reads two array sizes.
Reads two arrays that are already sorted in ascending order.
Creates a third array that merges them into one sorted array (like the merge step of merge sort).
Prints the result.
Example:
A = [1, 4, 5]
B = [2, 3, 10]
Result: [1,2,3,4,5,10]
